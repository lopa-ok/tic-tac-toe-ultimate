# Tic Tac Toe Ultimate

Tic Tac Toe Ultimate is an advanced version of the classic Tic Tac Toe game, built using JavaScript. This project includes features that go beyond the traditional 3x3 grid, making it more challenging and fun to play.


## How to play

- Players take turns to place their mark (X or O) in the mini-grids.
- Each move determines the mini-grid for the opponent's next move.
- The first player to win the majority of the mini-grids or get Three mini-grids in a row wins the game.
